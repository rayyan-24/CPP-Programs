 Design a class Money with data members (rupees, paise) such that it supports the following statements:

Rupees  r1(1000,50), r2;
float  Amount = r1; // Convert rupee to float
r2= Amount; // Convert float to rupee
Rupees has two data members- rs and p. Write default and parameterized constructors.
Write code to get the input and display the amount as “Rs.400.60”.

    money(float x)
    {
        this->rupees = int(x);
        this->paisa = x - this->rupees;
    }
    operator float()
    {
        return float(this->rupees + this->paisa);
    }
